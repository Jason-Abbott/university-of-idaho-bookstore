This repository is an historical record of work done for a campus retailer. It does not represent a current site.

- Created: **1994**
- Platform: EMWACS (precursor to IIS)

Working as the service manager in the computer department of a campus retailer afforded early access to high speed Internet. I used the opportunity to learn HTML, Perl and CGI (the tools of the time) to build a retail website displaying products loaded from vendor dBase or text files.

Subsequent versions took advantage of Microsoft's first data templating language (`htc` and `idc` files) for the web and later Active Server Pages with Server Side Includes and ODBC data connections.

# Innovations

There was no such thing as e-commerce when I built these sites. There were no online forums to consult. Everything was new.

I not only learned and wrote the code but I designed the layouts and created the graphics you see here with [Altamira Composer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altamira_Software), [Caligari trueSpace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueSpace) and later Photoshop (which wasn't very capable at the time &mdash; didn't even have layers).
