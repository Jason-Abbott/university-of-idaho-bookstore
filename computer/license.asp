<font face="arial"><b>Who</b></font>
<br>
We offer licenses from Microsoft, Apple and WordPerfect (soon to be Corel).  Please call
for information on specific offerings.  Computer Services, last I heard, offers licenses
for Novell, SPSS, SAS, Systat, ESRI and MicroX.  They can be contacted at 885-APAL.
<p>

<font face="arial"><b>How</b></font>
<br>
We used to produce diskettes, lend CD's and offer FTP downloads but in the new
program with Microsoft (and that's who we usually license) the licensee must
buy one, educationally priced shrink-wrap copy from which copies can be made on the
other machines for which licenses have been purchased.

<font face="arial"><b>What</b></font>
<br>
What does it cost?  Well, I used to have a database online but Matt has been lax
in providing updated prices so you'll just have to call or e-mail for current
pricing.  I plan to get something online again.
<p>

<font face="arial"><b>Why</b></font>
<br>
The biggest reason, presumably, is cost, a benefit which grows with the number of
licenses purchased.  Additionally, the Computer Department manages updates and keeps track
of your licenses, providing the licensee with some level of confidence.
