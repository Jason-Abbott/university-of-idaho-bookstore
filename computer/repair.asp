<br>
The University of Idaho Computer Department is authorized to repair IBM and Apple computers, monitors and printers.  We are also working to become authorized with both Hewlett Packard and Dell.  For now, we recommend contacting <a href="http://www.lewiston.com/business/valcom/" target="_top">ValCom</a> in Lewiston for Hewlett Packard repairs.  Their phone number is 208/743-4504.  Dell repairs can be facilitated by dialing the technical support number provided with your computer.

<font face="arial"><b>Turn-around time</b></font>
<br>
We strive to return products submitted for repair within two business days.  The availibility of repair parts and the number of products before yours in the que for repair can, however, extend the time required for repair.  For example, IBM once took a number of months to deliver parts necessary for monitor repairs.
<p>
It is my intention to computerize our work orders and make them available online so you can check the status of your machine and make inquiries online.
