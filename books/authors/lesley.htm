Thanks to everyone who attended the Craig Lesley reading of <b><i>The Sky
Fisherman</i></b> on September 12th.  Craig is a very lively and entertaining
speaker and <b><i>The Sky Fisherman</i></b> is a fantastic book.  The
event was a great success.
<p>
We still have a few signed copies of the <b><i>The Sky Fisherman</i></b> in
stock.  As Shawn Vidmar wrote in her review which appeared in the
<b><i>Argonaut</i></b> on September 10, "it cleverly combines a human story
with nature, art, innocence, scandal and life.  For those with a love of
rivers, either rafting or fishing, this is a must read.  For others who
enjoy a great, energetic story, this is also the book for you."  Pick up
your copy while they last.
