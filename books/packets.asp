<b><font face="arial">Tips for Better Quality Materials</font></b>
<br>
If you want your students to have clear and legible packets, here are some hints for compiling your master packet.
<font size=2>
<ul>
<li>Give us the original or best copy available.  You will get them back.
<li>When making the originals, provide sufficient margins for binding.  Rule-of-thumb:  3/4 inch.  
<li>Put the cover down on the copier or use the edge erase function if available.  Too much toner will hurt your machine and produce poor copies.
<li>Double check your materials to make sure the pages are in order and complete!
</ul>
</font>
<p>

<font face="arial"><b>Reprints</b></font>
<br>
We are committed to keeping the number of leftover packets as low as possible.  Not only is it important to save the trees, but the current paper shortage has resulted in spiraling prices. 
<p>
The most important factor in keeping student cost low is to minimize leftover packets.  To do this, we usually print approximately 80% of enrollment.  After the packets sell out, a notice is posted on the shelf to let the students know that they may order a reprint which takes 24 to 48 hours (not counting Sundays).  <b>Please encourage your students to not put off their purchase until the last minute.</b>
<p>
If this proves to be a great inconvenience to your class schedule, we will print 100% of enrollment if your department agrees to pay for the leftover packets.  This option is provided on the order form.
<p>
Your cooperation in keeping the number of leftovers down is greatly appreciated.
<p>

<font face="arial"><b>Deadlines</b></font>
<br>
To insure that your packet is available  the first day of class and that your students receive the lowest possible price, please submit your packet to the Bookstore by the appropriate due date.

We will gladly accept a packet after the deadline and make every effort to produce it as fast as possible but cannot guarantee it to be ready for the first day of class.  <b>All packets brought in by the deadline will be discounted 5% to your students!</b>

<font face="arial"><b>The Extras</b></font>
<br>
The following set-up services are available:
<font size=2>
<ul>
<li>Title page
<li>Table of contents
<li>Page numbering
<li>Mastering
</ul>
</font>
In addition, you may request a desk copy.  <b>Be sure to indicate desk copy quantity on the order form or you will not receive one.</b>  The fees incurred for these services can be paid for by supplying us with your department budget number or we can add them to the cost of the student's packets.  We highly recommend that you carefully consider this decision.  Especially in cases with small class enrollments, including these fees
may significantly increase the cost to your students.

<font face="arial"><b>Copyright &copy;</b></font>
<br>
Copyright exists in "original works of authorship" which are "fixed in a tangible medium of expression."  Copyright exists to foster and induce the creation of all forms of intellectual property, including books.  Copyright protection covers both published and unpublished works.  The Copyright Act of 1976 provides that copyright begins at the moment the work is created.  Registration with the Copyright Office is <b>not</b> required in order for a work to be protected under U.S. copyright law.  Works in the public domain, such as works created by the U.S. government, may be freely copied. The absence of notice cannot be relied upon to indicate that a work
is in the public domain.  Similarly, the fact that the author is deceased or the book is out of print does not mean that the work may be copied.  Fair use does not apply to copied material which is sold to students. If your packet contains borrowed material, we must ask the owner(s) of the copyright for permission to reproduce it for your class. Be aware of the following guidelines when compiling your packet:
<font size=2>
<ul>
<li>Copyright permissions must be renewed each semester.
<li>Pieces from a book in print are generally limited to 10% of the total page count.
<li>Most publishers charge royalties.  The average royalty is 5 cents per page, per copy, but  can often be much higher. 
<li>Response time from publishers varies and can take up to 6-8 weeks in some cases, or can be denied.
</ul>

<font face="arial"><b>Bibliography</b></font>
<br>
A well prepared bibliography is essential.  Without the correct and complete information, we cannot write to a publisher to ask permission to copy.  Publishers require the following information in order to process our request:
<font size=2>
<dl>
<dt><b>For Books:</b>
<dd>Author/Editor, Title of Book, Edition #, Copyright Year, Publisher, Chapter Title and Author, Page Numbers, ISBN
<dt><b>For Journals:</b>
<dd>Author/Editor, Title of Journal, Issue #, Copyright Year, Publisher, Article Title, Page Numbers
</dl>
</font>
Without all of the above information, our letter will be incomplete and a publisher may not be able to reference our citation, and will <b>deny</b> permission to copy.
