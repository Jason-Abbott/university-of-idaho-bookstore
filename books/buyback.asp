<font face="arial"><b>Purpose</b></font>
<br>
The purpose of Buyback is to give U of I students an opportunity to recycle their unwanted textbooks for cash at semester's end and, at the same time, provide students in the upcoming term with more used books as an alternative to new books. Since it helps students both at the beginning of the semester when they purchase and at the end of the semester they recycle, it's the most effective way the bookstore can help students save money on textbooks.
<p>

<font face="arial"><b>How it works</b></font>
<br>
Currently the bookstore prices new books at a 5% discount from the publisher list price.  Used texts are 75% of the publishers list price. Used books purchase with a U of I Vandal Card are reduced another 5%. The bookstore pays 50% of the publisher's list price for books that are being reused locally in the coming semester(s) and are not already overstocked.  We can offer a national wholesale price for books that aren't being re-used locally. Typically these prices can range from 0-33% of the publisher's
list price, depending on demand. The following is an example based on a $50.00 book (not an uncommon price at all these days).

<font face="arial"><b>The value of your used book</b></font>
<br>
The value of your used book is truly market or demand driven.  Books that have been adopted by instructors for re-use in the following semester on campus bring the highest buyback price — 50% of the Publisher's list price. Books that aren't being used locally are bought back by a wholesaler for the national market.  Since the wholesaler has to ship books back to their warehouse, restock them and then resell them to other college stores, they naturally pay less than the bookstore does for the books that are staying
on campus.  The wholsaler determines the price they'll pay at buyback by tracking national demand for books and the publisher's revision cycles. The wholesaler's prices for your books range from 0 - 33% of the publisher's list price generally.
<p>

<font face="arial"><b>If your book has little or no value</b></font> at Buyback it's usually because of one or more of the following reasons:
<ul>
<li>A signed course request has not been submitted to the bookstore for your book
<li>It's not being re-used locally
<li>There's little or no demand for it nationally
<li>It's overstocked in the local or national market
<li>It's an old edition or soon to be an old edition
</ul>

<font face="arial"><b>The following illustrates the powerful savings potential</b></font>
that is available for students who are able to purchase used books and then
recycle them as compared with buying new and recycling or not recycling at all.  Note that, if you <b>buy used books</b> and are able to <b>resell them to the bookstore</b>, the actual amounts you pay with and without a Vandal Card are just 21.5 - 25% of the original publisher's list price of $50.00.
