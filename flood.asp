<p>
By the time <a href="http://www.uidaho.edu/~gbunce">Greg</a> and I (Jason) got out with the camera the water level had dropped 6 to 18 inches.  I wanted to go earlier but my co-workers made fun of the idea, saying that the water wasn't going to suddenly disappear.  They were wrong, as usual.  While I did miss the most exciting flooding I still managed a few telling shots with the store's QuickTake camera.

When I got to work on Friday the ninth of February I had to wade through a bit of water to get to the rear entrance of the store.  Paradise Creek, which runs behind the store, had exceeded its banks and was lapping against the loading dock.  Unfortunately, by the time I went out with the camera this had receeded (see above), so rather than photographing muddy pavement I just took a shot of the front of the store.

Walking (north) down the street that runs in front of the store, Deakin, I took these shots of the little Sixth Street bridge.  Normally you'd have to strain to see any water at all flowing under the bridge.  When the water was at its highest it looked close to over-running the bridge.

These are pictures of the same creek as seen running parallel to Sixth Street, shot looking west and shot looking east (playground in view).  If you haven't seen the creek in it's normal state — a trickle hidden by grass — then it might not seem impressive but for us Idahoans who rarely get the excitement of natural disasters it was neat to see (or so I, one Idahoan, thought).

On the other side of Paradise Creek (opposite Sixth Street) is Gormley Park.  When I walked over there, though, it looked more like Gormley lake.  Normally, you wouldn't see any water at all in these pictures.  There's a school (elementary or something) right next to the park that looked like it may have been flooded.  At least the abundance of mud indicated that the school parking lot had been submerged.

Accross the street from Gormley Park is some family housing.  Judging by the water line that was left on their walls it looked like they'd had about a foot of water in their living rooms.  Not fun.  Some poor soul failed to move their car from the parking lot behind the apartments.  Ironically, the sandbags that were used to keep the water in the creek and away from the apartments was, when I was there, serving just the opposite purpose, preventing the water in the lot from running back into the creek.
