Our general book department stocks a wide variety of titles that support the
interests of this campus. Fiction, non-fiction and reference titles are all
well represented. We also maintain an extensive collection of titles on
Pacific Northwest topics.
<p>
We welcome suggestions for titles that you feel that we should carry and we
are always happy to special order the titles that we don't happen to have in
stock.
